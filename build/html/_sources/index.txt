--------
Overview
--------

SimpleSBML is a package that can be used to construct biological models in 
SBML format using Python without interacting directly with the libSBML package.  Using 
libSBML to build models can be difficult and complicated, even when the model
is relatively simple, and it can take time for a user to learn how to use the 
package properly.  This package is intended as an intuitive interface for 
users who are not already familiar with libSBML.  It can be used to construct 
models with only a few lines of code, print out the resulting models in SBML
format, and simplify existing models in SBML format by finding the SimpleSBML 
methods that can be used to build a libSBML version of the model.

Classes and Methods
-------------------

.. class:: sbmlModel(self, time_units='second', extent_units='mole', sub_units='mole')
    
    sbmlModel is used to construct simple models using libSBML methods and 
    print out the model in SBML format.  A user can add species, parameters, 
    reactions, events, assignment rules, rate rules, and initial assignments
    to a model.  Then, the user can view the model in SBML format by printing
    the string representation of the class.
    
    sbmlModel contains two attributes: *document*, an 
    `SBMLDocument <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_s_b_m_l_document.html>`_ 
    object, and 
    *model*, the 
    `Model <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_model.html>`_
    attribute of *document*.
    
    .. function:: addCompartment(self, comp_id='')
    
        Adds a `Compartment <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_compartment.html>`_ 
        of volume 1 litre to the model.  If the user does
        not specify *comp_id*, the id is set to 'c<n>' where the new compartment
        is the nth compartment added to the model. All sbmlModel objects are 
        initialized with a default compartment 'c1'.
    
    .. function:: addSpecies(self, species_id, amt, comp='c1')
    
        Adds a `Species <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_species.html>`_ 
        to the model.  If *species_id* starts
        with the '$' symbol, the species is set as a boundary condition.  *amt* is
        the initial amount of species within the specified compartment in moles.
    
    .. function:: addParameter(self, param_id, val, units='per_second')
    
        Adds a `Parameter <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_parameter.html>`_
        to the model.  *val* is the value of the parameter, and
        *param_id* is the parameter id.  If units are not specified by the user,
        the default units are 1/sec.
    
    .. function:: addReaction(self, reactants, products, expression, local_params={}, rxn_id='')
    
        Adds a `Reaction <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_reaction.html>`_
        to the model.  
    
        *reactants* and *products* are lists of species
        ids that the user wishes to define as reactants and products, respectively.
        
        *expression* is a string that represents the reaction rate expression. 
        
        *local_params* is a dictionary where the keys are local parameter ids and
        the values are the desired values of the respective parameters.  
    
        If the
        user does not define a reaction id, it is set as 'v<n>' where the new
        reaction is the nth reaction added.
    
    .. function:: addEvent(self, trigger, delay, assignments, persistent=True, initial_value=False, priority=0, event_id='')
    
        Adds an `Event <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_event.html>`_ 
        to the model.  
    
        *trigger* is the string representation of a 
        logical expression that defines when an event is 'triggered', meaning 
        when the event is ready to be executed.  
    
        *delay* is a numerical value that defines the amount of time between when 
        the event is triggered and when the event assignment is implemented, in 
        previously defined model-wide time units.  
    
        *assignments* is a dictionary 
        where the keys are variables to be changed and the values are the 
        variables' new values.  
    
        *persistent* is a boolean that defines whether the 
        event will still be executed if the trigger switches from ``True`` to ``False``
        between the event's trigger and its execution. 
    
        *initial_value* is the value of *trigger* when t < 0. 
    
        *priority* is a numerical value that determines
        which event is executed if two events are executed at the same time.  The
        event with the larger ``priority`` is executed.
    
        .. note:: An event is only triggered when the trigger switches from ``False`` to 
            ``True``.  If the trigger's initial value is ``True``, the event will not be 
            triggered until the value switches to ``False`` and then back to ``True``.
    
    .. function:: addAssignmentRule(self, var, math)
    
        Adds an `AssignmentRule <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_assignment_rule.html>`_
        to the model.  An assignment rule is an equation
        where one side is equal to the value of a state variable and the other side
        is equal to some expression.  *var* is the id of the state variable and *math*
        is the string representation of the expression.  
    
    .. function:: addRateRule(self, var, math)
    
        Adds a `RateRule <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_rate_rule.html>`_
        to the model.  A rate rule is similar to an assignment
        rule, but instead of describing a state variable's value as an 
        expression, it describes the derivative of the state variable's value
        with respect to time as an expression.  *var* is the id of the state variable
        and *math* is the string representation of the expression.
    
    .. function:: addInitialAssignment(self, symbol, math)
    
        Adds an `InitialAssignment <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_initial_assignment.html>`_
        to the model.  If the 
        initial value of a variable depends on other variables or parameters, this
        method can be used to define an expression that describes the initial value
        of the variable in terms of other variables or parameters.  *symbol* is the
        id of the variable and *math* is the string representation of the expression.
    
    .. function:: getDocument(self)
    
        Returns the 
        `SBMLDocument <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_s_b_m_l_document.html>`_ 
        object of the sbmlModel.
    
    .. function:: getModel(self)
    
        Returns the 
        `Model <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/classlibsbml_1_1_model.html>`_
        object of the sbmlModel.

.. function:: writeCode(doc)

    Returns a string containing calls to SimpleSBML functions that reproduce
    the model contained in the SBMLDocument *doc* in an sbmlModel object.

.. function:: writeCodeFromFile(filename)

    Reads the file saved under *filename* as an SBML format model and
    returns a string containing calls to SimpleSBML functions that reproduce
    the model in an sbmlModel object.

.. function:: writeCodeFromString(sbmlstring)

    Reads *sbmlstring* as an SBML format model and
    returns a string containing calls to SimpleSBML functions that reproduce
    the model in an sbmlModel object.
